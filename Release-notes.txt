GhostBSD 10.3 Release notes
	
	GhostBSD provide hybrid ISO images, for i386 and amd64
	architectures. The amd64 ISOs are UEFI enabled.
	
	You can either burn the image onto a DVD media or "dd" it
	to a USB stick device, use of third party tools to transfer
	the images to USB sticks is higly discouraged and not supported.

	That single ISO can be used either as a "live" media and as
	an "installer" image.
	
	GhostBSD is fully compatible with the upstream FreeBSD version,
	however some default setting might differ.
	
	Use of Grub2 boot loader is a notable exception.


~~~ Requirements
	
	Minimum system requirements

	- x86 or x86-64 CPU
	- 1 GB RAM
	- 40 GB disk free storage
	- Intel, AMD-ATI, or Nvidia graphics adapter.
	
	
~~~ i386 specific:
	
	While i386 arch is fully supported there exists some limitation:

	- some program may require some specific cpu feature:
	  notably flash player plugin require a SSE2 capable cpu
	
	- PAE is not supported from GhostBSD, that limit the maximum usable
	  RAM to approx 3 GB. (that is 4 GB address space minus addressing
	  reserved for hardware, mostly graphics adapter memory.)
	
	- UEFI is not available nor supported on i386.

	- ZFS may run on i386 systems, but it is not suggested, we leave
	  that option available only for testing, evaluation, and/or 
	  educational purposes.
