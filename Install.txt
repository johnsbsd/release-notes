Boot loader / boot manager:

GhostBSD provide FreeBSD boot manager, FreeBSD loader, and Grub2.

Grub2 provide both functionality in one program (boot manager / loader),
while traditionally FreeBSD provide two separate programs.

FreeBSD "loader" will be aways installed, no matter what you select
at installation.

Which one to use install depend on a number of factors but mainly 
we suggest Grub2 if:

- you are going to dual boot AND you have some experience with grub2

We suggest "no boot manager" if your install will be exclusively GhostBSD,
and specifically when:

- you are new to FreeBSD/GhostBSD,

Reason is most of the documentation doesn't take in consideration Grub2
at all, and this may result in additional difficulties for new users,
using the traditional FreeBSD loader is higly suggested.
