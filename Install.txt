~~~ Boot loader / boot manager:

	GhostBSD provide FreeBSD boot manager, FreeBSD loader, and Grub2.

	Grub2 provide both functionality in one program (boot manager / loader),
	while traditionally FreeBSD provide two separate programs.

	FreeBSD "loader" will be aways installed, no matter what you select
	at installation.

	Which one to use install depend on a number of factors but mainly 
	we suggest Grub2 if:

	- you are going to dual boot AND you have some experience with grub2

	We suggest "no boot manager" if your install will be exclusively GhostBSD,
	and specifically when:

	- you are new to FreeBSD/GhostBSD,

	  Reason is most of the documentation doesn't take in consideration Grub2
	  at all, and this may result in additional difficulties for new users,
	  using the traditional FreeBSD loader is higly suggested.

	- Using already installed boot managers, from Linux or other systems:

~~~ Disk Layout and Partitioning
	
	Single disk
	Multiple disks
	Dual boot and filesystems interoperability considerations

	ZFS

~~~ Graphics

	GhostBSD provide the same support as FreeBSD, with some additional
	tweaks needed for a smoother use on live / installed systems.

	If a graphics adapter is not supported from FreeBSD, it will not be
	supported from GhostBSD too.


~~~ Networking
	
	GhostBSD provide its own network manager, using a graphical interface,
	it does work well if the following conditions are met:
	- your network adapter is recognized and supported upstream
	- in same case a licence acknoledgement is required before
	  the adapter can work.

~~~ Updating
	
	GhostBSD provide update-station which update system+world and pkgs.

	Ports actually aren't automatically updated
	Neither are our GhostBSD specific packages.

	We are fully aware of the limitations and we are working to set up our
	own repo and finally overcome these limitations.
